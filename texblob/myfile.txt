I am writing this review with deep concern and disappointment regarding the MILTON Premium 3 Burner Black Manual Ignition LPG Glass Top Gas Stove that I purchased from Amazon in July 2023. To put it bluntly, this product is an absolute disaster and poses a severe risk to safety.

From the outset, the gas stove seemed to function reasonably well. However, after just one month of use, it has become a constant source of fear and danger. The most alarming issue is that it sets on fire randomly, with no apparent trigger or warning. This is not only inconvenient but outright life-threatening.

The so-called "premium" features of this stove are a facade, as the quality and reliability are shockingly subpar. The glass top, which is supposed to enhance the aesthetics, is now a constant reminder of the regrettable decision to purchase this product. Not only does it fail to add any value, but it also becomes dangerously hot during use.

The manual ignition system is another major flaw. It has become highly unpredictable, igniting at any time and any place. This not only wastes gas but also poses a significant risk of burns and injuries. I shudder to think about the potential consequences if this were to happen when someone is not in the immediate vicinity to address the issue.

I have attempted to contact MILTON customer service for a resolution, but the lack of response and support only adds to the frustration. It is disheartening to invest in a supposedly premium product only to receive a hazardous appliance and zero assistance when problems arise.

In conclusion, I strongly advise against purchasing the MILTON Premium 3 Burner Black Manual Ignition LPG Gas Stove. It is not only a waste of money but a genuine threat to the safety of your household. I urge Amazon to reconsider featuring such unreliable and unsafe products on their platform, as they jeopardize the trust and well-being of their customers. This experience has been a harsh reminder that not all products sold online live up to their promises, and safety should never be compromised for aesthetics or brand names.

Customers like the cleanability, ease of installation, value, appearance and size of the portable stove. For example, they mention that the smooth glass surface is effortless to wipe clean, the burners and pan supports can be easily removed for cleaning and that it's best value for money. Opinions are mixed on flame and performance.

I am utterly dismayed by the appalling quality and lack of customer service provided by Milton. I recently purchased their gas oven, hoping for a reliable and durable appliance. However, within a mere 12 days of purchase, the glass top of the oven shattered into pieces while I was in the middle of cooking! This not only posed a significant safety hazard but also left me without a functional oven. Despite this clear manufacturing defect occurring well within the warranty period, Milton shockingly refused to take responsibility or offer any assistance in fixing or replacing the oven.

Their blatant disregard for customer satisfaction and safety is absolutely unacceptable. Not only did I waste my hard-earned money on a subpar product, but I also endured unnecessary stress and inconvenience due to their negligence.

I urge potential customers to steer clear of Milton's low quality glass ovens and their defective appliances. It's disgraceful that they prioritize profit over customer well-being and refuse to stand behind their products. Save yourself the headache and invest in a brand that values its customers and produces reliable products.

Stove is durable but does not work with piped gas unless the nozzle is changed. Quite a hassle to get it done as after speaking with Milton their advise was to follow up with Gas agency & get it done!! Very difficult to return, only exchange is possible..
